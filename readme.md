# Czerka Developer Tools

A command line interface (CLI) used to aid in the development of applications made by Czerka Corporation.

# Installation

There are two ways czerka-dev-tools can be installed. Use whichever works best for you.

## NPM Install

```bash
$ npm i -g @czerkacorp/czerka-dev-tools
```

This will install the package globally on your machine so that you can use the commands in any directory, at any time.

## NPX

```bash
$ npx -p @czerkacorp/czerka-dev-tools -c "<command>"
```

If you have a version of NPM that comes with NPX, you can run the commands without having to install the package globally. Run the command above, replacing `<command>` with one of the commands below and NPX will locate the package and run the command for you without the need to install via `npm i -g`.
